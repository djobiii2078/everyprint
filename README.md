Getting Started with Everyprint docs
------------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 2.3.1 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

1. Fork this repository on GitHub or clone the repository on your hard drive with  `git clone https://github.com/djobiii2078/everyprint.git`.
2. `cd everyprint`
3. Initialize and start the everyprint docs. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567.
